		<p>This framework is heavily based round SASS and Compass. It tries to make the more used elements of websites easier to put together and customise. I have created many fairly complex mixins which can all be customised to how you like. Then they can be used as you please throughout. The main aim of this framework is to try have as little reliance on a default set of classes, and rather use mixins to quickly get through the majority of elements. As well as providing a smart set of defaults and helpers, that you control the use of. That was the main reason I created this framework as we evolve and change our patterns to suit our own needs. I dislike having someone define my coding style, as I'm sure you do too.</p>
